Security Testing in Open Source Web Applications: A Comparative Study of Issue Tracking Tools
This study aims to evaluate security vulnerabilities in web open source tools for issue tracking, based on the criteria proposed by ISO/IEC 27000 series standards and OWASP Community. The Owasp Guide was used to conduct the tests considering 10 most frequent vulnerabilities and the Owasp Zap tool was used to automate the tests. The tests were applied on three open source issue tracking tools namely Redmine, Mantis Bug Tracker and Bugzilla. The tests reports revealed few security vulnerabilities in the Redmine tool, but a lot of them in the context of Mantis Bug Tracker and Bugzilla.
