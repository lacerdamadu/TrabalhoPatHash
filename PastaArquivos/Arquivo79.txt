Analysis of a User-Centered Safe Routing Solution for Urban Buses
Studies on mobility flows have become increasingly significant due to the exponential growth of data collection devices and applications. Despite this, few research efforts address this topic, and tools to support such analyses remain scarce. This work implements a tool designed to facilitate mobility flow studies and demonstrates its application through a case study evaluating the impact of safe route implementations in SÃ£o Paulo. The results indicate that this solution can enhance existing mobility research by providing finer-grained insights into urban changes and their effects on travel patterns. By quantifying how specific route modifications alter movement dynamics, the tool offers actionable data for urban planners seeking to optimize transportation networks while prioritizing safety.
