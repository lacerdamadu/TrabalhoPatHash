TRAVELING SALESMAN PROBLEM WITH TIME WINDOWS: AN APPLICATION PROPOSAL FOR SAO GERALDO LUMBER COMPANY (ITAUNA-MG)
The Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Window (TSPTW) is an important optimization problem because of the savings generated in transportation costs and the final price of the products. This paper presents a proposal for the resolution of a real identified TSPTW in the company Madeireira São Geraldo de Itaúna Ltda., more specifically in the delivery service. All requests have time windows for delivery time, such as before or after a certain time. A solution to the problem is found through an algorithm developed using the concepts of Genetic Algorithms (GAs). To demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm, three different experiments are performed, varying the population size and number of individuals. In the first, the result is compared to a benchmark with similar characteristics; And in the two other, the obtained results for the real problem are compared to the result of a simple greedy algorithm. In the first experiment the algorithm found solutions close to or equal to optimal. In the second and third experiments, the costs found by the algorithm are 56.55% of the greedy solution.
