Beef Cattle Weight Prediction Using Computer Vision
Monitoring the weight of beef cattle is extremely important for livestock producers. This study proposes an automated method to predict animal weight by extracting information from images using computer vision and machine learning algorithms. Unlike conventional mechanical scales, this new approach involves creating a dataset of cattle images to train a U-NET model for animal segmentation. Relevant features are then extracted, and machine learning models are trained to predict cattle weight. The solution was implemented in Python and executed on Google Colab and Google Cloud Virtual Machines. Results demonstrate the methodâ€™s effectiveness, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 12.83 kg.
