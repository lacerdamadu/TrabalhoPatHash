Vehicle Access Control and Surveillance System Prototype Using Computer Vision
Until a few decades ago, motor vehicles were inaccessible to most of the Brazilian population, but today, they are a reality in many households. However, they are not only targets for theft but are also used to commit crimes. With this growing number of vehicles in circulation and their misuse for illegal activities, there is increasing interest in monitoring themâ€”whether for traffic control, parking management, offender identification, or other purposes. To address this need, this work proposes the development of an algorithm capable of recognizing vehicle license plates in images (photos) and videos and extracting their characters for further analysis. The goal is to leverage these results to develop a real-world application for vehicle flow control, such as in garages, parking lots, or surveillance systems. For this purpose, the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model was used as the convolutional neural network, trained on a custom dataset and tested on real-world traffic footage. The results show that the model achieves 90% accuracy in plate detection and 50% success in character extraction, demonstrating its potential for practical deployment in automated vehicle monitoring solutions.
