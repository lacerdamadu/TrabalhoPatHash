IBGE Cidades Data Collection and Provisioning System
The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) is the official body responsible for maintaining and disseminating statistical data across the national territory. However, the current data provision system—often unintuitive—hampers efficient extraction for in-depth analysis. This article presents a system designed to streamline data extraction, leveraging data science principles and computational tools to capture IBGE data, reformat it into an accessible structure, and store it in a local database for visualization and analytical purposes. The collected data provides critical insights into Brazil’s socio-economic landscape, including living conditions and public resource allocation. By simplifying access to this information, the project adopts a socially impactful role, empowering citizens to engage with and question national conditions. The strategies employed prioritize ease of assimilation, achieving the core objective of making IBGE data comprehensible and actionable for a broader audience.
