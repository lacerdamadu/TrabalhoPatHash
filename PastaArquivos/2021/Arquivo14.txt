Automatic Detection of Crop Planting Rows
The automatic detection of planting rows in different crops is not a simple job and requires an effort to be performed manually by the farmer. The automation of this process is a good example of an application that has become promising with the insertion of digital technology in agriculture to plan crop routes. This paper compares the performance of three agricultural crop row identification algorithms based on software simulated images and photographs captured by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The results of the proposed solutions were validated by the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) metric by comparing the results with the idealized path masks. The results obtained a performance of up to 99.5%.
