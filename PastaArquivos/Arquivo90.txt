Implementing a Gamification Approach in a Participatory Sensing Mobile App
Participatory Sensing Networks (PSNs) often struggle with low user engagement, leading to insufficient data collection that compromises analysis quality. To address this challenge, this work implements a gamification framework as an intrinsic incentive mechanism within an event-support PSN app developed by the Center for Pervasive and Distributed Systems (NesPED) at the Federal University of Viçosa, Florestal Campus. By incorporating game elements—including points, rankings, rewards, and user groups to enhance social interaction—alongside a quantitative anti-spam mechanism for opinion submissions, the system achieved significant results during a case study at a Computer Science Academic Week. Groups using the gamified module demonstrated markedly higher engagement, with 12× more feedback submissions compared to non-gamified versions, while maintaining data quality. These findings validate gamification as an effective strategy for boosting participation in civic technologies without compromising data integrity.
