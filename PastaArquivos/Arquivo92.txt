Melanoma Skin Cancer Detection Using Digital Image Processing and Artificial Neural Networks
Skin cancer ranks among the most prevalent cancers in Brazil, with melanoma representing one of the most aggressive and lethal forms. This study proposes a computer-aided detection system that leverages digital image processing to analyze key dermatoscopic features—including lesion symmetry, color distribution, and border irregularity—followed by classification via artificial neural networks. The methodology aims to standardize early melanoma identification by quantifying clinically validated ABCDE criteria (Asymmetry, Border, Color, Diameter, Evolution) through computational methods, reducing subjectivity in visual assessments. By integrating traditional image processing with deep learning, the system provides a dual-validation approach suitable for both clinical decision support and teledermatology applications in resource-limited regions.
