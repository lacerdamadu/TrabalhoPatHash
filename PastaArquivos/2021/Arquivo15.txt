Identification of Drought-Resistant Eucalyptus Species Using Machine Learning
The identification of drought-resistant eucalyptus species can bring numerous advantages to the world industry. Currently, with high climatic variations occurring globally, with emphasis on prolonged dry seasons, thousands of hectares of eucalyptus have had their production impaired. As this is a vital raw material for the industry, its loss causes damage in several segments. This work aims to use two machine learning methods: Decision Tree and Random Forest, with the purpose of identifying, based on data collected in the field, which are the most relevant variables to classify a eucalyptus species as resistant. or not to dry. In the end, it will be possible to observe that the highest accuracy of eachof the models mentioned were respectively: 70.2% and 63.1%, and the most important bioidentifiers, for classification, in order of relevance were: leaf water potential, specific leaf area and leaf length.
