Identification of Drought-Resistant and Productive Eucalyptus Crossbreeds Using Leaf Images
This work used a convolutional neural network (CNN) – NasNetMobile – to identify productive and drought-resistant eucalyptus crossings based on leaf analysis. The dataset comprised 17,790 images after augmentation, divided into 4 classes. The final test involved three stages: (I) optimizing the number of dense layers, (II) testing Dropout and L2 regularization, and (III) performing 10-fold cross-validation. The best model achieved 82.69% training accuracy, 63.96% validation accuracy, and 56.70% test accuracy
