DCluster: A System for Exploratory Analysis of Large-Scale Georeferenced Data
The growth and diversification of mobile device usage—particularly smartphones—has generated vast volumes of georeferenced data from mobile applications. Consequently, businesses are increasingly interested in analyzing this data to better understand their users and improve services. Georeferenced data analysis remains an underexplored field with the potential to yield more actionable insights than raw data alone. Current data analysis tools generally lack native support for geospatial attributes and require users to possess advanced technical knowledge. This work proposes a system designed to assist data analysts in exploring and visualizing large-scale, heterogeneous datasets—including georeferenced data—without demanding specialized expertise.
