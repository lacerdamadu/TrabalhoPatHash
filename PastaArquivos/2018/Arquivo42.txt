SCRUM TACTICS: Using Gamification in Scrum-Based Project Development
Nowadays, with everything running very fast and dynamic, it is difficult to maintain a level of productivity in the scenarios that people are involved in when it comes to software development. Agile methodologies, such as the Scrum framework, are widely used to manage software development projects in a lightweight way in order to improve the software quality and team organization. However, the act of developing is not seen as amusing and is often considered wearisome and monotonous. Gamification is a term that has been approached quite often among scholars, in different settings, influencing the type of practice of people in their respective environments. Gamification has characteristics that present a way to perform the activities in a more pleasurable way, generating satisfaction and motivating those involved in a project. The present work seeks to relate concepts present in the Scrum framework with concepts present in game design and to map to a new approach. The main contribution of this research is to demonstrate the positive effects of this mapping, inserting motivational aspects in such a way that positively influence the social, cultural and educational relationship of a specific group.
