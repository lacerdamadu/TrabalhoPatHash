Comparison of Unsupervised Algorithms for Information Security Anomaly Detection
Considering the widespread use of computational systems in various contexts and the amount of sensitive information they produce, it becomes essential to pay attention to their security. The objective of this work is to explore the use of clustering techniques and statistical analyses for anomaly detection in an information security dataset. A comparative analysis will be conducted between different techniques in the NSL-KDD dataset, in terms of precision, selected attributes, execution scenario, among others. Five unsupervised techniques were chosen for comparison: Random Forests, Local Outlier Factor, Elliptic Envelope, K-Means, and HBOS. The obtained results vary considerably depending on the applied scenario. After analyzing the results, it became evident that the performance of the chosen techniques is sensitive to the context and their configuration of application.
