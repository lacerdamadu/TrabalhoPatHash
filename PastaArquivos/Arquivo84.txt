Automatic Segmentation of Bovine Carcass Images
The percentage of exposed fat on a bovine carcass is a key statistical metric for quantifying fat coverage, serving as a critical indicator of carcass quality and market pricing. Traditionally, this assessment requires in-person evaluation by specialists who analyze the ratio between the whole carcass and its collagen/muscle regions (areas without fat coverage). This work proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach to automate fat percentage estimation. A domain expert annotated an image dataset with three segmentation classes: (1) carcass contour, (2) collagen regions, and (3) muscle regions. The trained CNN achieved validation scores of 42.7% mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) across all classes, with particularly strong performance (98.2% mAP) for carcass contour detection. While collagen/muscle segmentation requires further refinement, these results demonstrate the viability of computer vision for augmenting—and potentially standardizing—a traditionally subjective meat grading process. The high contour detection accuracy suggests immediate utility for automated carcass measurement systems in slaughterhouse environments.
