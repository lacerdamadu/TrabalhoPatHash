Identification of Drought-Resistant and Productive Eucalyptus Hybrids Using Leaf Imagery
This study applied a NasNetMobile convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify productive and drought-resistant eucalyptus hybrids through leaf image analysis. The augmented dataset consisted of 17,790 images categorized into 4 distinct classes. The experimental protocol was divided into three phases: Phase I optimized the number of dense layers in the network architecture, Phase II evaluated regularization techniques (Dropout and L2 penalty), and Phase III implemented k-fold cross-validation with k=10 for robust assessment. The top-performing model achieved 82.69% training accuracy, 63.96% validation accuracy, and 56.70% accuracy on the test image set, demonstrating the potential of lightweight CNNs for phenotypic screening in forestry applications.
