DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION APPLIED TO THE ROBUST ECONOMIC DISPATCH OF ELECTRIC POWER PROBLEM
Thermal power generation has significantly higher production costs compared to other methods, such as hydropower. Energy generation involves multiple factors—including pressure, humidity, and temperature—that may introduce uncertainties. In this context, this work proposes a solution to the Robust Economic Power Dispatch Problem (REPDP), considering valve-point loading effects and parametric uncertainties through the Differential Evolution (DE) metaheuristic. The proposed DE algorithm was implemented in C and tested on REPDP instances with 13 and 40 generating units (GUs). To validate its effectiveness, results were compared against solutions from three benchmark studies in the literature. The developed algorithm demonstrates validity, with nominal results closely matching existing literature, while achieving lower computational costs in the robust formulation compared to other approaches.
