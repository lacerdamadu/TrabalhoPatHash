Investigating Temporal Information for Collaborative Filtering and Markov Chain Performance in Mobile App Recommendation
With the growing use of mobile devices, an increasing number of applications are being developed and published to meet consumer needs. However, the sheer volume of options often leaves users overwhelmed when selecting mobile apps that truly match their requirements. A common solution to this problem involves developing recommender systems that predict and suggest apps users would likely install independently. In this work, we leverage chronological installation sequences from 14,000 users to enhance traditional recommendation algorithms. Our results demonstrate an average improvement of 16% in recall for collaborative filtering and 36% for Markov Chain-based recommendations compared to non-temporal versions of these models. These findings highlight the critical role of temporal signals in personalizing mobile app suggestions, particularly for capturing evolving user preferences and installation patterns over time.
