Performance Evaluation of Physiological Signal-Based Key Agreement Protocols for Wireless Body Area Networks
Devices on a wireless body area network monitor clinical signs of patients. The importance contained in these data suggests that they should be transmitted and maintained in a private and secure manner. Thus, the importance of adhering to security protocols, such as authentication between network devices, is evident. However, the devices that make up the body network have specific limitations. These limitations can be pointed out as batteries with low energy capacity, in addition to the reduced data transmission capacity, low processing power, and others. Based on the security principles and the specificities of the network, this work aims to present an empirical analysis about the performance and consumption of hardware resources by authentication protocols. In this investigation, methods that use physiological signals to produce the secret keys of each section were considered. Analyzes were carried out about execution time, memory consumption, goodput, in addition to the false acceptance and false rejection metrics about authentication attempts. When exploring the results obtained, the highlight of a protocol on execution time and the need for more accurate synchronization for application in real scenarios is remarkable. However, the lesser memory consumption and greater precision during the authentication process of the rival method.
