Evaluation of Bird Migration Patterns Using Public Citizen Science Repositories
The lack of data has always been an obstacle for the understanding of the birds migratory movements, especially in the tropics. The recent development and increasing popularity of various projects of Citizen Science have provided a great set of data to the scientific community, which has grown exponentially. Such data have been colected and tabuladed by people without academic training, thus require a distinguished management and validation, because, otherwise, they can lead to innacurate conclusions. The study of migratory patterns of certain birds species is a good example of the use of Citizen Science, because birdwatchingâ€™s increasing popularity in tropical regions has allowed a data accumulation of species and regions that, so far, have never been satisfactorily sampled by the scientific community. The purpose of this paper is to use the Data Science and Citizen Science conjointly, in order to evaluate the reliability of the data that have been made available by two datasets with distinct characteristics, one based in vouchers (WikiAves) and the other based in undocumented observations (eBird). We have studied the migratory movements of four different birds species, with different migration patterns: Amazona pretrei, Attila phoenicurus, Casiornis fuscus and Tangara peruviana. Our results show that the WikiAves dataset, after analysis, was more satisfactory and consistent with the migratory patterns, compared to the eBird.
