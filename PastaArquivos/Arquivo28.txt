Assessment of Configuration Management Process Maturity in Open Source Projects
With the increasing of contributors and companies in open source projects it is necessary to study the maturity of the adopted development processes. This paper proposes quantitative metrics, based on the CMMI, MPS.BR and OMM models, to evaluate the maturity of Software Configuration Management (SCG) processes in open source projects. The metrics were automated and applied on data from 6 projects hosted on GitHub. The results were unsatisfactory, in terms of best practices of the SCG. Furthermore, for all the projects were found some gaps in terms of the change control flow and the traceability of the releases configuration items.
