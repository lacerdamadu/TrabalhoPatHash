Draw the Function: An Educational Game to Support Learning of Mathematical Functions
Educational games are an attractive way of teaching between most of the young students of high school or college, although itâ€™s still not much explored by the teachers of schools or/and universities. Many times those students fails in finishing their course by lack of interest in classes, specially in the area of exact sciences, since most of them consider such disciplines difficult. Therefore, this work presents the development, analysis and tests of the game Draw the Function, an educational game for teaching in the area of exact sciences, specifically mathematical functions. During the tests we observed that Draw the Function has a pedagogical capacity, helping in the teaching of mathematical functions as well as being an attractive and motivating game for its players.
