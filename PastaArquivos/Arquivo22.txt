Development of an Application to Support the Teaching-Learning Process in Graph Theory
This paper presents the process of developing an application to aid in the teaching and learning of Graph Theory, to encourage and facilitate learning, using a graphical user interface that respects UI / UX standards and can run on multiple platforms. An idea that the student can use the resource to reinforce the content learned through the classroom and see how the algorithm works on graphs drawn in the application. In addition, an application even shows the relevant characteristics about the graph, which can display transparent information, which can be used to identify a specific characteristic of a given graph.
