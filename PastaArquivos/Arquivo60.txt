Usability Evaluation of Event Participation Support Applications
In recent years the evolution of technology has brought significant changes of great impact, especially on mobile devices. The features offered by todayâ€™s cell phones make it
much easier to perform some tasks, which were previously only available through textit
desktops. It is important to note that mobile applications need to be practical, but they
also need to interact in a pleasant way with their users. Thus, the objective of this work is
to perform the usability evaluation of two applications, Whova and MyMobiConf, which
are used for supporting participation in events. Two types of evaluation will be used, the
heuristic evaluation, which is supported by a checklist in order to indicate usability failures through a technical look, and the usability test, which already aims to focus on the
user experience in Highlighting the factors of ease of learning and satisfaction in use. The
results obtained indicated a higher level of user satisfaction compared to the functionality
offered by MyMobiConf. While Whova presented better results compared to the technical
aspect presented by their interfaces.
