Extraction of Semantic Mobility Signatures from User Trajectories
Human mobility patterns serve as indicators of individual preferences and can be represented as networks of spatiotemporal locations. Studying these patterns to understand behavioral profiles is crucial for applications such as targeted advertising campaigns. However, few studies leverage large-scale GPS datasets to define societal mobility contexts. This work analyzes high-volume GPS data to extract semantic mobility signatures, aiming to characterize shifts in movement patterns during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The results reveal altered mobility behaviors following the easing of restrictions, particularly through the adoption of hybrid work-study models. These findings demonstrate how granular trajectory analysis can capture systemic behavioral changes, providing actionable insights for urban planners and policymakers navigating post-pandemic mobility transitions.
