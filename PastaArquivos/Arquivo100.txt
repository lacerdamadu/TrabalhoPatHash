Hardware Router with Reconfigurable Congestion Control Policies
The demand for increasingly faster computer networks, driven by the mass use of connected devices requiring high transfer rates and low latency, raises issues such as congestion control in routers. In this work, we propose a hardware-implemented router with reconfigurable congestion control policies, enabling the use of congestion policies at runtime without the need to recompile or restart the router when the user changes how congestion should be handled during execution.
Our work was implemented on the NetFPGA 1Gb platform and tested in a real-world environment. Our results show that our architecture allows congestion policies to be modified at runtime, dynamically controlling congestion without relying on the leaf nodes of the network.
