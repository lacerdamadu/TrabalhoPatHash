Evaluation of the Impact of Meltdown and Spectre Vulnerabilities in Modern Processors
Modern processors have adopted new measures to improve their performance. The first, out-of-order execution, allows instructions further down the flow to be executed in parallel with previous ones. Another approach was speculative execution, which executes instructions assuming they will indeed be needed later. However, it was recently discovered that both techniques allow access to memory locations that should not be reachable. Thus, major companies in the field, such as Intel, AMD, ARM, among others, developed patches to fix these generated vulnerabilities. Even though they mitigate the impacts caused by attempts to access private memory locations, the patches directly affect the performance of current systems. This article presents a study on these vulnerabilities, known as Meltdown and Spectre. We examined the effect and efficacy of speculative execution and, upon success, were able to calculate the impact on computational performance with and without the security patch. Based on tests conducted on benchmarks, we observed a performance loss of slightly over 10% in protected systems.
