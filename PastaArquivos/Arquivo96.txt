Native XML as an alternative to the classic relational model
With the increasing evolution and adoption of computational technologies in daily life, it is possible to notice a visible rise in the relationship between data users. This has created a need to resolve the volatility of any data by making it persistent while also being retrieved in an integral and trivial manner. In this context, this work aims to explore the feasibility of Native XML Databases (NXMLDB) as an alternative to Relational Databases (RMDB) through an empirical and comparative approach. The proposed approach consists of a series of experiments involving two databases (XML and SQL) and a script of operations whose metrics are based on the number of tuples processed versus the time required to process them.
