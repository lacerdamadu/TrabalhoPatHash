CCEdu: an application to facilitate the first contact with programming logic
The search for more sophisticated tools and teaching methods have grown significantly in recent years, especially due to the scarcity of relevant and low priced artifacts in the context of programming logic learning. It was realized the need to introduce knowledge of computer science area in basic education a long time ago. To make this possible, this kind of knowledge should be presented from an early age, instigating the child’s imagination with a more practical and fun material. With this in mind we have built an educational toy that aims to teach and entertain children from 6 years of age, presenting programming logic friendlier than older and conservative methods of teaching, along with low cost attached to it’s simple built. We performed tests with children to experiment the toy, and analyzing the data collected based on the proposed age range, we could observe that the essence of the application, of teaching the basis of sequential programming logic, was achieved.
