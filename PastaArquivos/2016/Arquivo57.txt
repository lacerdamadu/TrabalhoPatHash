Development of a Collaborative Environment for Academic Project Management
This work proposes a collaborative environment to support the development of academic projects based on the 3C model. This environment is called Colab-UFV and supports the work of
multidisciplinary teams, the coordination in activities development and assignment, cooperative
production of artifacts and communication between members of a project. The environment is
a computational tool to support group work and collaborative learning, built on the principles of
CSCW and CSCL, respectively. As a tool to support education, Colab-UFV favors learning through experimentation, stimulating teamwork and communication among those involved. The
environment also covers an analysis of the performance of team members through quantitative
measurements on collaborative data.
