Multiclass Semantic Segmentation of Bovine Carcasses
Due to the increasing competitiveness of the meat industry and growing demand for high-quality products, the adoption of technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in production lines has become essential. This is particularly evident in contexts requiring precise carcass feature extraction, such as cut delineation. This study implements a neural network for multiclass semantic segmentation of bovine carcasses, identifying three key regions: Forequarter, Rib, and Hindquarter. The developed technique significantly enhances carcass measurement efficiency by reducing processing time on slaughter lines, minimizing interruptions, and limiting professionals' direct contact with carcassesâ€”thereby lowering contamination risks and improving process reliability. The primary evaluation metric, Cross-Entropy Loss, yielded an 11% validation loss, demonstrating satisfactory performance given the constrained dataset of only 88 images (72 for training, 16 for validation). These results highlight the method's potential to modernize meat industry workflows while addressing both productivity and food safety challenges.
