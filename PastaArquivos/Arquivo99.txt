DCluster: A System for Exploratory Analysis of Large Volumes of Georeferenced Data
The growth and diversification of mobile device usage, especially smartphones, has led to a large volume of georeferenced data originating from mobile applications. As a consequence, companies are increasingly interested in analyzing such data to better understand their users and thus offer better services. The analysis of georeferenced data is still a relatively unexplored Ã¡rea and can provide more useful insights than raw data alone.
In general, current data analysis tools do not handle georeferenced atributes and require prior user knowledge to apply advanced techniques. This work proposes a system aimed at assisting data analysts in the exploration and visualization of large volumes of varied data types, including georeferenced data.DCluster: A System for Exploratory Analysis of Large Volumes of Georeferenced Data
