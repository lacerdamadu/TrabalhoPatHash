Genetic Algorithm for the Economic Power Dispatch Problem Under Uncertainties
The presence of uncertainties can change the value of the objective function to be optimized as well as the values of the constraint functions, therefore the achieved solutions can become
infeasible and/or with undesirable costs. This paper proposes a robust version of the Economic
Dispatch Problem (EDP), where parametric uncertainties are considered. Three techniques were
implemented to deal with the uncertainties in the problem. The three techniques were incorporated
in a genetic algorithm in order to solve the EDP. Inicially, it was shown that solutions that desconsider the uncertainties (nominal solutions), when subjected to the uncertainties (disturbed nominal
solutions), are susceptible to significant deterioration in their objective values. In the experiment, it
was verified that the robust solutions, obtained from the proposed techniques, have better objective
values that the disturbed nominal solutions objective values. The student wrote the text, built the
mathematical model, implemented the code and performed the experiments.
