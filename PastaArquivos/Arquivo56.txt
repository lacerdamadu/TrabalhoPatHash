UC-GeM: A Usability-Centered Design Methodology
This paper presents the definition of a usability centred generic methodology for the conception
of web systems. It was built based on the principles of the User Centred Design Process,
presented by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The methodology defines the disciplines
of UX Analysis, UX Design and UX Evaluation, supported by tasks which define, develop and
evaluate the interfaces of a web system that comply with the users characteristics, needs, and
objectives. Its construction was formalized on the Eclipse Process Framework (EPF). The paper
also presents how the developed methodology can be applied to the Waterfall and Iterative and
Incremental process models.
