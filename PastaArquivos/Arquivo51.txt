A Game Studies-Based Gamification Approach for Computer Science Courses
This paper evaluates the application of a gamification approach based on researches on the field of study known as “game studies” to a freshman computer science class, since both these areas have a weak connection in the literature. In order to achieve it, an approach to aspects that aim to generate fun in games is merged with aspects to rise motivation among those involved in gamification applications. This approach lasts for the whole semester, and the students who had an active participation showed better levels of performance, socialization and interest on computer science classes and the university campus, as well as a decrease in the average level of computer science evasion.
