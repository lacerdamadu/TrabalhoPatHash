2GCMA: An Evolutionary Algorithm-Based Automated Causal Model Generator
While association remains a powerful tool for business analytics, it does not inherently imply causation—a distinction that has driven significant research efforts in recent years. These advances have introduced new challenges, particularly in the automated generation of causal models, which is fundamental to rigorous causal studies. Existing tools often struggle with high-dimensional scenarios, creating a critical gap for real-world applications involving numerous variables. This work proposes an evolutionary algorithm-based solution designed to efficiently suggest causal models, specifically optimized for large parameter spaces. Evaluated on a dataset with 14,000 entries and 63 dimensions, our approach successfully generated a relevant causal model where two established benchmark tools failed to produce satisfactory results. Future work will focus on refining the tool’s precision and efficacy in causal effect discovery, particularly for complex, high-dimensional domains.
