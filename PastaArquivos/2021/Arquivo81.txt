Strategy Pattern Applied to Multi-View Data Generation in ColMinerRT Library
The use of design patterns enables developers to implement widely tested strategies within specific domains. This work employs the Strategy pattern to enhance the maintainability and extensibility of the ColMinerRT library, which is designed to import data from GitHub, calculate topic relevance metrics, and persist results in CSV format. By applying this pattern, we implemented a modular mechanism for generating exportable data, introducing a new presentation layer that supports multiple structured data views. Post-implementation analysis demonstrated significant improvements in code organization and decoupling, facilitating future additions of new visualization formats. These architectural refinements confirm the pattern's efficacy in balancing flexibility with robustness, particularly for tools requiring adaptable data representation in software engineering workflows.
