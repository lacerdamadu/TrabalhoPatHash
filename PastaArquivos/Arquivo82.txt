A Mixed-Methods Analysis of Diversity's Impact on Agile Team Productivity: An Industrial Study
This article investigates how diversity influences productivity and artifact quality in teams using agile methodologies. Through a mixed-methods industrial study involving four teams with varying diversity profiles, we collected data via: (1) a tri-dimensional questionnaire and (2) metrics extracted from development support tools. Results demonstrate that more diverse teams consistently achieved superior productivity indicators and higher output quality, suggesting that inclusive team composition correlates with enhanced performance in agile environments. These findings provide empirical support for diversity initiatives in technical workplaces while highlighting measurable benefits beyond social equity considerations.
