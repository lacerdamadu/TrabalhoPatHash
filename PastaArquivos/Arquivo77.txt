Investigating RNNs and GNNs for App User Churn Prediction
Service providers face significant revenue losses due to customer attrition—a phenomenon known as churn in the literature. While retention campaigns can mitigate this issue, blanket offers to all customers often prove cost-prohibitive. This study evaluates the performance of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for churn prediction against two benchmarks: a traditional Random Forest model and a deep Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), using only non-sensitive customer data in a digital service abandonment context. Results demonstrate the GNN’s strategic value: though it achieved secondary performance in accuracy (61% vs. RNN’s 63%) and macro F1-score (59.95% vs. 61%), it outperformed both baselines in churn class recall (68% vs. RNN’s 55% and Random Forest’s 61.5%). These findings suggest GNNs better identify at-risk customers despite marginally lower overall metrics—a critical advantage for targeted retention efforts. Future work will extend this graph-based approach to generic event-sequence problems by incorporating additional data modalities and model features.
