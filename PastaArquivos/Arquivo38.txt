An Evaluation of Energy Consumption in Medium Access Control Protocols for Wireless Body Area Networks
Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) have been widely employed in medical environments to aid communication between devices and the transmission of collected data, such as vital signs of patients. As it serves to support medical applications, WBANs require reliability on the communication between sensor nodes and base stations. However, given the natural vulnerabilities of wireless communication, such as inferences and losses, solutions need to bypass issues faced in wireless communication. In this paper, we evaluate the power consumption of devices in a scenario similar to a hospital environment in order to compare the DCAA and PDAC protocols, both specifically designed for wireless body networks. The experiments demonstrate a slightly higher power consumption for PDAC compared to DCAA. However, because it has a more robust and efficient channel control and allocation, PDAC offers characteristics that benefit the quality of the communication, which accredits it as an adequate protocol to WBAN.
