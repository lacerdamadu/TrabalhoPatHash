An Instagram-Integrated Sticker Album as a Participation Incentive Strategy for the myMobiConf System
Participatory Sensing Networks (PSNs) are systems where data-sending nodes consist of individuals with mobile devices. These systems often struggle with user engagement issues. myMobiConf—a PSN designed for event support—employs gamification strategies to address this challenge.
Inspired by successful PSNs like Instagram and Brazil’s cultural affinity for sticker albums, this work proposes implementing an Instagram-integrated sticker album to enhance myMobiConf’s gamification framework.
