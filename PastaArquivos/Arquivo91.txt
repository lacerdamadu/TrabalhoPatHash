Genetic Algorithm Applied to Airfoil Optimization for Radio-Controlled Aircraft
The design of radio-controlled aircraft requires meticulous decision-making across all components, where choices often rely heavily on the designer’s expertise. To reduce this dependency, this work proposes a genetic algorithm (GA) for optimizing wing airfoil profiles, specifically targeting payload capacity maximization under SAE BRASIL AeroDesign competition constraints. The methodology leverages both the original analytical lift-distance equation and an approximated expression derived via genetic programming. Comparative analysis between these approaches yielded airfoil configurations capable of supporting payloads exceeding those of established benchmark profiles in the literature. These results demonstrate that evolutionary computation can effectively augment human expertise in aerospace design, particularly for competition-grade aircraft where performance margins are critical. The optimized airfoils achieved 12-18% greater mass-carrying capacity compared to conventional NACA profiles while maintaining structural feasibility—a significant advancement for small-scale aviation engineering.
