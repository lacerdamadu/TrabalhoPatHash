The Great Revolution: A Serious Game for Teaching Industrial Revolution History
With the rise of digital inclusion, electronic games have become an increasingly popular form of entertainment. This platform can serve multiple purposes, including as an educational tool that blends entertainment with content delivery, enabling students to learn interactively while developing additional skills depending on the game's design. However, creating educational games involves significant complexityâ€”from defining curricular content and gameplay mechanics to selecting appropriate technologies and implementing quality assessment processes. These challenges necessitate careful analysis of multiple factors when developing game-based learning projects. This work documents the comprehensive process of scoping, developing, and evaluating The Great Revolution, a serious game designed to teach Industrial Revolution history. Utilizing game development tools like Tiled and Unity, along with standardized narrative design frameworks, we created an immersive historical experience. The game was tested with high school students at UFV Florestal Campus and evaluated using the MEEGA+ method and Likert scale surveys. Results showed 83.64% positive and 10.30% negative feedback, indicating strong reception. The project yielded two key outcomes: 1) a validated game that effectively teaches its target content, and 2) a generalized development flowchart that can streamline future educational game projects by outlining best practices from narrative design to classroom implementation.
