Evaluating Novel Algorithms for the Analysis and Planning Modules of Autonomous Sensor Elements
Wireless Sensor Networks are used in different contexts, including
monitoring of climatic aspects in a remote region, actuators for geographic and
spatial events as well as applications in military or medical area. However, this
particular type of network has a limited power capacity and this directly impacts
its processing capacity and the amount of available memory. Based on this limitation scenario a generic model that seeks to use a more balanced way the
computational resources of the network was developed, with autonomic computing concepts that create a self configurable network. In this paper we develop
instances based on this generic model to improve network performance and prolong its service life. We have implemented two more sophisticated algorithms
and analyze their behavior in experiments performed in real sensor networks,
also known as testbeds. The results show that the implementations maintain or
improve important aspects such as the number of sent messages and the number
of packets transferred across the network.
