A Social Network Analysis-Based Approach to Measure Collaborative Participation in Software Projects
Several tools are used in software development that record the information about team work. In general, these tools have different vocabularies, which makes it difficult to measure team collaboration. In this context, this paper presents a tool capable to integrate collaborative data from heterogeneous sources and performing the analysis of collaborative participation in software projects. The analyses are done after the application of commonly used metrics in social networks that evaluate the relevance of a node in relation to the network. For the evaluated software project, 87.5% of the most active users were present in the exchange of messages and the coordination of tasks; Other 80% were involved in both the message exchange and the shared edition of artifacts.
