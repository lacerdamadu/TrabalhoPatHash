Evaluating Transfer Learning for Sentiment Analysis in the MyMobiConf Event Participation Support System
Transfer learning leverages knowledge from pre-trained models designed for one task to enhance performance on another, addressing critical challenges in machine learning such as limited data quality and quantity. This study evaluates how transfer learning techniques can impact—either positively or negatively—the sentiment analysis model within the MyMobiConf event support system. We implemented the TrAdaBoost algorithm, which specializes in instance transfer, and analyzed the behavior of the resulting model. Our findings demonstrate that the selected algorithm yields beneficial outcomes under specific parameters: when iteration counts are capped at 25, the approach improves model accuracy by up to 9%. These results highlight the potential of instance-based transfer learning for optimizing sentiment analysis in domain-specific applications while revealing its sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning.
