Evaluating Collaborative Performance in Academic Projects: A Role-Based Accountability Analysis
This work analyzes data from an academic software engineering teaching project to evaluate collaborative participation through a case study approach. By modeling repository data from project support tools as graphs and applying centrality metrics, we examine the relationship between node centrality and student roles across two dimensions of the 3C Collaboration Model (Coordination and Cooperation). Results reveal: (1) managerial roles (e.g., Scrum Masters) dominated in coordination activities (betweenness centrality δ=0.78), (2) specific developers and testers showed unexpectedly high cooperation (degree centrality ≥15), and (3) role-performance mismatches where 23% of participants underperformed their assigned responsibilities. These findings provide empirical evidence that formal role definitions alone don't guarantee balanced collaboration, highlighting the need for automated contribution tracking systems in project-based learning environments.
