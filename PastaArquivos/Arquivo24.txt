MapReduce Cluster and Annotation Tool for Rapid Analysis â€“ An Environment for Biological Data Annotation and Enrichment
The development of new generation sequencing techniques has brought a large volume of biological data and new computational challenges related to it. Within this context the Human Genetic Diversity Laboratory has developed a tool that gathers information from 11 public biological databases. Despite having been successful in this integration, the way the tool was implemented was not the most efficient, which led to an unnecessary expense consuming computational resource and time in the return of the analysis. In this work we re-engineered the tool in a distributed and parallel environment through a computer cluster, using the Apache Hadoop framework, with the objective of supporting the processing of this large data volume. Early tests showed that the new tool was successful, spending considerably less memory and time on the heavier tests. In addition, a new SNP annotation tool is also proposed in the context of this new environment.
