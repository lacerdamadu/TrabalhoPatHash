Comment Topic Relevance and Gender Diversity in Open-Source Projects
This study examines female participation in open-source projects through the lens of comment topic relevance in GitHub's issue tracking system. It further investigates potential relationships between thematic relevance and developer-specific metrics such as reputation, platform tenure, and reported issue frequency. Analyzing data from five general open-source communities and five women-focused communities, the results reveal that while women's comments demonstrate equivalent topic relevance to men's—indicating comparable technical capability—their representation remains disproportionately low: women authored only 22% of all comments and 16% of reported issues. These findings highlight a persistent gender participation gap despite parity in contribution quality, underscoring the need for targeted interventions to improve inclusivity in OSS ecosystems.
