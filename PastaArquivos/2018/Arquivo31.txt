CrawMobi: A Web Service for Semantic Data Enrichment Through Mobile Device Feature Collection
In the context of mobile services, it is crucial that a company that develops these services knows its customers. One way to provide this knowledge is to profile users. An important aspect of such a profile concerns the characteristics of the mobile device used by the user. However, getting these features is not an easy task. In this work, a meta-data web service was developed to extract details of smartphones from trusted sites, returning a database with details about the type of device used. With the data returned, some testing and analysis was done to get the profile description of mobile users.
