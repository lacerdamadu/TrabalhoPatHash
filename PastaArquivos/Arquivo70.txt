Virtual Plenary: A Comparative Political Ideology System for Municipal Legislative Candidates in Belo Horizonte
This paper introduces a web-based system designed to simulate a Virtual Plenary for comparing the political ideologies of candidates running for municipal legislative positions. The platform provides an interactive environment where users can participate in a simulated plenary session and subsequently compare their policy choices on proposed bills with those of elected council members. By analyzing these decision patterns, the system generates a comparative assessment of the user's political ideology relative to officeholders. The solution incorporates a user-friendly interface, robust data collection and processing mechanisms, and employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to construct its comparative ideological framework. System efficacy and usability were validated through empirical testing with real users, demonstrating its potential as a civic education tool that bridges the gap between citizens and their elected representatives through data-driven political alignment visualization.
