A Gamification Approach Based on Game Studies Using a Digital Card Game
The use of elements present in games in academic scope has been reported in the literature. The objective of this work is to assess the application of a gamification approach based on game studies, which uses a digital card game as an auxiliary tool. This approach was applied in the first year of a Computer Science undergraduate course. The students involved answered two forms, one applied in the beginning and another at the end of the approach. Beyond that, data generated by the use of the game was collected too, and from the analysis of all this data set it was possible to conclude that the elements used in the approach generated positive results regarding the motivation of the students.
