Analyzing Rework Hotspots in Software Repositories: A GitHub Project Study
This study conducts a multimodal analysis of issue tracking and version control data to identify rework hotspots in software projects, focusing on two distinct issue categories: (1) issues with associated code commits, and (2) highly discussed issues that failed to produce code. Using data extracted from GitHub repositories, we applied statistical correlation analysis, multiple regression modeling, and hypothesis testing to examine relationships between four key parameters: commit frequency, comment volume, developer count, and issue reopening rate. Our joint analysis revealed significant correlations (p<0.01) between these metrics and rework likelihood, with particularly strong effects in non-convergent issues (R²=0.68). The findings suggest that discussion intensity without code resolution may be a stronger predictor of technical debt than implementation activity itself—a counterintuitive insight with implications for project managers prioritizing backlog refinement. The methodology provides a reproducible framework for early rework risk detection across the software lifecycle.
