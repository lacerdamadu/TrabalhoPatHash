User Satisfaction Analysis of Collaborative Systems for Software Engineering Support: A Comparative Study
Studies show the relevance of measuring the user satisfaction of groupware used in a software process. The user satisfaction may influence product efficiency, team motivation and project results. This research proposes a comparative approach to measure user satisfaction of collaborative tools used to support the software process based on the use of the following qualitative techniques: Thinking Out Loud and Questionnaire. The work presents the results of tests involving 8 volunteer students from an academic project. The students were divided into two groups of profiles according to their performance in the project. The results reveal that more productive students had different opinions about satisfaction for both techniques and a positive trend according to the Questionnaire results. On the other hand, the results from another group were very close for both techniques and there was a trend toward neutrality in terms of satisfaction.
