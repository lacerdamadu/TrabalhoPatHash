Genetic Algorithm Applied to Classroom Allocation: A Case Study at UFV Campus
The Classroom Assignment Problem is an obstacle recurrent in the institution of degree
level on Brazil. The Classroom Assignment Problem consists in allocate classes of subjects in
predefined classrooms searching attend the max of restrictions of the model. This paper has by
objetive present a genetic algorithm able to create viable and quality allocations for the Classroom
Assignment Problem based in the physical structure of the Universidade Feral de Vic¸osa - Campus
Florestal. The data used for generate the computational experiments were collected by means of real
allocations existents on the Campus. The use of the genetic algorithm for resolve the Classroom
Assignment Problem has generated solutions of quick form and with high quality, then showed
efficient for being applied on UFV - Campus Florestal.
