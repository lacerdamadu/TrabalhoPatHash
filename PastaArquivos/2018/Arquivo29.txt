Evaluation and Refinement of a Genetic Algorithm for Multi-Component Optimization Problems
Recently a new problem has been proposed to better contemplate the interdependence between the components of real problems, the Traveling Thief Problem. This problem results from the combination of two classical problems of computation, the TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem) and the KP (Knapsack Problem). Because it is a multicomponent problem, the optimal solution of the sub problems does not guarantee the optimal solution of the problem as a whole. Different approaches have emerged to address this problem. The proposed algorithms generally make use of Meta Heuristics, and because of this they have a large number of parameters to be defined. However choosing these parameters properly is not a simple task, since they directly affect the quality of the solutions found. To assist in this process some automatic configuration tools have arisen and are based on searching in the parameter space the configurations that improve the performance of the optimization algorithms. This work aims to find the best parameters for a genetic algorithm used in the resolution of the Traveling Thief Problem, making use of these tools.
