Teaching-Learning-Based Multiobjective Optimization Applied to the Robust Version of the I-Beam Problem
The presence of uncertainties, such as parametric ones, in optimization problems can cause nominal solutions to become infeasible. In this paper we propose an algorithm based on the metaheuristic Teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) that solves the robust version of the I-Beam Problem, taking into account this type of uncertainty. The implementation has a non-robust algorithm called NMOTLBO that obtains solutions that disregard uncertainties (nominal solutions), and a robust algorithm with the application of two uncertainty techniques, the WCSA (RMOTLBOWCSA) and the WCE (RMOTLBO-WCE). The experiments show that nominal solutions, when in the presence of uncertainties, have a drastic deterioration in the values of their objective functions. In addition, the results indicate that through the Hypervolume and IGD metrics the robust solutions found are better than the nominal solutions when subjected to the worst cases of uncertainties.
