Who Makes the Difference? An Analytical Approach to Software Project Stakeholder Communication
This article presents a novel approach for constructing stakeholder communication networks in software projects by mining data from issue tracking systems and code repositories. The methodology synthesizes three established techniques: topic relevance analysis, sentiment mining, and social network metrics to identify key stakeholders through node centrality calculations. To operationalize this approach, we developed ColMiner 2.0—a tool that automates GitHub data extraction, network generation, and customizable node/edge metric visualization. A proof-of-concept validation demonstrates strong correlation (ρ=0.82, p<0.01) between the most central stakeholders in communication networks and those with the highest code commit frequencies, suggesting that our network topology effectively captures developer influence patterns. The tool's modular architecture allows teams to: (1) visualize knowledge flow bottlenecks, (2) detect sentiment-driven conflicts early, and (3) optimize issue assignment based on topic expertise—addressing critical pain points in distributed software development.
