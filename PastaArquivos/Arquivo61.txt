Mobile App Usage Profile Characterization
The large amount of information generated by the advances of mobile
technology makes the service providers get more and more interested in collecting and analyzing such data. In this study, we investigate a real and large-scale
dataset related to the use of mobile applications to identify patterns of access,
data traffic, period of use, and transition among services. The characterization
results reveal that different services are consumed differently by their users. Based on this investigation, we propose an algorithm to identify users with access
patterns of predominantly few apps. The results point out that the proposed
algorithm leads to good precision when identifying such users.
