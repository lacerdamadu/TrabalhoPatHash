Evaluation of a Medium Access Control Protocol for WBANs on GNU Radio
Rising healthcare costs and population aging have accelerated research in ubiquitous computing for medicine. Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) emerge as a promising technology for multi-environment patient monitoring. However, despite their recognized benefits, WBANs face critical challengesâ€”including susceptibility to interference and channel congestion in deployment environments. While numerous solutions address similar issues in general wireless networks, most fail to meet the stringent requirements of medical applications. The DCAAMAC1 protocol (Dynamically Channel-Adjustable Asynchronous MAC) was specifically designed for WBANs, prioritizing low latency and Quality of Service (QoS). Incorporating cognitive radio (CR) capabilities, it enables rapid asynchronous channel switching. This work evaluates DCAA-MAC's performance against medical-domain specifications and implements it on GNU Radio for research applications. Real-device emulation of a hospital-like environment demonstrated <1% data loss and maximum confirmed-data latency of ~40ms.
