MoreData+: Semantic Enrichment for Large-Scale Geospatial Datasets
The MoreData tool aims to streamline the workflow of geospatial analysts by automating semantic enrichment processes that are typically performed manually. However, its original architecture lacked efficiency in handling large-scale datasets, particularly in terms of processing time. This work introduces a redesigned data model for MoreData, leveraging GeoPandas and Dask-GeoPandas libraries to enable scalable operations. We conducted quantitative benchmarking of execution time, memory usage, and CPU utilization across the new implementations. The results demonstrate significant reductions in data enrichment processing times, enabling MoreData to efficiently operate on massive geospatial datasetsâ€”a critical advancement for applications requiring real-time or near-real-time spatial analytics at enterprise scales.
