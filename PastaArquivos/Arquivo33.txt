FOUD: A Context-Aware Opportunistic Framework for Corporate Data Upload
Many organizations need to collect data where Internet access is compromised. Skills, surveying, mining, reporting, biological studies, and environmental monitoring are examples of these activities, most of which are carried out in rural areas where wireless network technology does not work or operate at a reduced range. In this way, the data obtained, and which normally need to be sent to a central server, may arrive late and / or error. This paper presents an alternative that aims to facilitate the service of companies or government agencies that work with data collection under these conditions. It is an framework, opportunistic and context-aware, aimed at constructing systems for upload data collected in areas where access to network technology is of low quality or non-existent. The model produced for the framework performs the sending of data when verifying network availability, prioritizing the use of the network in situations in which energy and data packet are available. The implementation of this model for Android showed that it is possible to develop it for a particular system in particular, and that it can contemplate particularities of each system, such as the contexts, meta data of the files and more appropriate transmission logics in each case.
