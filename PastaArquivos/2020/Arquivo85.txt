Serverless Intrusion Detection System on a SmartNIC
Data security has become a critical factor in computer networks. Between 2015 and 2020, estimated losses due to online data theft reached R$26 trillion (âˆ¼$5 trillion USD). In this landscape, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are essential for threat detection. However, traditional IDS solutions run on general-purpose machines with limited processing power and high operational costs. Offloading network functions to SmartNICs combined with serverless computing emerges as an efficient alternative, offering both flexibility and hardware-accelerated packet processing. This work proposes a serverless IDS with user-defined filtering offloaded to a Netronome SmartNIC. We implemented multiple filters using eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) technology to validate the system. Results demonstrate line-rate attack detection, proving the viability of this approach for high-performance, cost-effective network security.
