Inferring Personality Traits from Mobile App Usage
Understanding customer profiles is an effective way to deliver better, more personalized services, enhance satisfaction, and maintain long-term engagement. A key aspect of such profiling involves assessing user personality, typically categorized into five distinct traits. However, inferring these traits is non-trivial. This work investigates whether personality traits can be deduced based on the categories of mobile apps installed on a user’s device. We developed both classification and regression models, achieving promising results with an acceptable margin of error. These findings demonstrate the viability of app-based personality inference—a scalable alternative to traditional surveys—while highlighting opportunities for hyper-personalized recommendations in marketing, mental health, and user experience design. Notably, the approach bypasses privacy-invasive methods like text analysis, relying solely on app metadata.
