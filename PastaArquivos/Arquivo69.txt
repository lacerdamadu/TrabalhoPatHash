Impact of Thematic Relevance and Communication Attributes on Issue Resolution Time
In software development projects, the time required to resolve an issue can be influenced by multiple factors, including the number of developers involved, the issue's complexity, the experience level of contributors, multitasking demands, and the presence of polite communication. Understanding which factors most significantly impact resolution time is crucial for optimizing efficiency and improving project outcomes. This study investigates how specific attributes extracted from GitHub issue trackers—particularly comment thematic relevance, discussion volume (measured by comment and participant counts), and the participation of top developers (in issue creation, discussion, or resolution)—affect resolution timelines. Focusing on the Ruby on Rails organization due to its active issue-tracking ecosystem, we employed Spearman’s correlation analysis to quantify relationships between variables, supplemented by hypothesis testing. The results reveal three key findings: First, issues and pull requests initiated by top developers demonstrate significantly shorter average resolution times. Second, increased discussion volume (both in comments and participant count) correlates with longer resolution periods, particularly when examining issues in isolation. Third, thematic relevance scores for comments were predominantly low, typically ranging between 0 and 0.1, suggesting limited topic coherence in most discussions. These findings provide empirical evidence that strategic developer allocation and discussion moderation could substantially improve issue resolution efficiency in open-source projects.
