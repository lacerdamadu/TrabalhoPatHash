An Indoor Localization and Navigation Solution for the MyMobiConf System
Currently, numerous technologies leveraging GPS (Global Positioning System) for localization are available across various application domains. However, the accuracy of these technologies can vary significantly, particularly indoors where satellite signals are often obstructed by building structures. Alternative approaches for such scenarios typically rely on additional infrastructure to improve precision. In contrast, this work proposes a solution that utilizes only built-in smartphone components to deliver a viable navigation system for myMobiConf, an event participation support application. The implemented solution demonstrates effectiveness across a wide range of building types, making it adaptable to diverse event venues. Additionally, it employs sensor fusion techniques to mitigate inherent errors associated with inertial navigation systems, enhancing reliability without requiring external hardware.
